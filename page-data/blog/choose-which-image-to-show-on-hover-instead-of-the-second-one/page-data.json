This is even more truthful and less abstract when it comes to e-commerce stores. Being able to quickly showcase your product&#8217;s advantages (its images, features, price, etc) will help your customers form their opinion more quickly in regards to what they do and don&#8217;t want and, subsequently, will help you make more sales.<br><br>Bearing that in mind, most Shopify themes nowadays allow additional images of a product to be displayed when the user hovers over the main product image. This is an excellent feature, however, you  may want to have control over your theme and feature other product images on hover instead of only the second image. Perhaps your products&#8217; best images are the third one, not the second and so on and so forth.<br><br>Today I will be showing you how you can achieve the same results with just some quick copy and paste code snippet.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"NoticeBox NoticeBox--info\"><p>This tutorial is compatible only with Shopify&#8217;s official free themes: <b>Dawn, Refresh, Colorblock, Taste, Ride, Studio, Crave, Origin, Spotlight, Publisher, Sense &amp; Craft.</b></p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-step-1-adding-the-code\">Step 1: adding the code</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>From your Shopify admin, navigate to <strong>Online Store &gt; Themes &gt; Actions &gt; Edit Code &gt; Sections &gt; card-product.liquid</strong><br><br><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"966\" height=\"572\" class=\"wp-image-2519\" style=\"width: 600px;\" src=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/card-prod-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/card-prod-1.jpg 966w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/card-prod-1-850x503.jpg 850w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/card-prod-1-768x455.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 966px) 100vw, 966px\" /><br></li>\n\n\n\n<li>press <strong>CTRL + F</strong> (or <strong>CMD + F</strong> on <strong>Mac</strong>) to open the search bar and search for exactly this (spaces included):<br><br><strong>and show_secondary_image</strong><br><br>You&#8217;ll find a <strong>&lt;img</strong> tag below it.

To choose which image to show, simply change the number on the right to the line &#8220;second_image_number&#8221;. So, if you&#8217;d like to display the fourth image of your products on hover, it would look like this:<br><br><strong>{% assign second_image_number = 4 %}</strong><br><br>If the image is not available, the hovering function will simply show the very first image.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, displaying other product images on hover is an excellent feature that is worth A/B testing to have concrete results whether it will work for your specific business. Generally it does tend to enrich the website&#8217;s user experience, increase sales, and help customers make informed purchase decisions. Having control over your theme and easily choosing what image to display without the need to hire developers or install apps is a must.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ezfycode.com/blog/add-slideshow-shopify-no-apps\">&#8211; How to make slideshow images stop cutting off</a><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UKO9ViFXaWQ\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\">&amp;lt;br>&amp;lt;a href=&#8221;https://ezfycode.com/blog/collection-with-tabs-shopify-section-tutorial&#8221; target=&#8221;_blank&#8221; rel=&#8221;noreferrer noopener&#8221;>- Add a collection tabs slider to any store (copy/paste, no apps, blazing fast)&amp;lt;/a>&amp;lt;iframe width=&#8221;560&#8243; height=&#8221;315&#8243; src=&#8221;https://www.youtube.com/embed/MuD0FgqENoc&#8221; title=&#8221;YouTube video player&#8221; frameborder=&#8221;0&#8243; allow=&#8221;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&#8221; allowfullscreen=&#8221;&#8221;>&amp;amp;amp;lt;br>&amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=&#8221;https://ezfycode.com/blog/how-to-disable-right-click-image-and-text-copying-without-apps&#8221;>- Disable right click, image and text copying and improve your store&#8217;s security&amp;amp;amp;lt;/a></iframe><br><a href=\"https://ezfycode.com/blog/collection-with-tabs-shopify-section-tutorial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8211; How to add a collection with tabs section to any theme (copy/paste, no apps, blazing fast)</a><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MuD0FgqENoc\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\"><br><br></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tired of always displaying the second image on hover?
