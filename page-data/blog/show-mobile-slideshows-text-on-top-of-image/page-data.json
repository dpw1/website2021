For the past few years, Shopify has chosen to go via the latter route: even the first Shopify themes like Debut and Minimal would always display the Slideshow&#8217;s banner below the images on mobile devices. <br><br>To the amuse of some and the disappointment of others, the same approach has persisted in the latest batch of themes with the Dawn series. <br><br>However, worry not since this is a fairly simple fix. In today&#8217;s tutorial I&#8217;ll show you how you can show slideshow&#8217;s banner on top of the image.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"NoticeBox NoticeBox--info\"><p>This tutorial is compatible with all Shopify&#8217;s official free themes: <b>Dawn, Refresh, Colorblock, Taste, Ride, Studio, Crave, Origin, Publisher, Sense &amp; Craft.</b></p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-step-1-adding-the-code\">Step 1: adding the code</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>From your Shopify admin, navigate to <strong>Online Store &gt; Themes &gt; Actions &gt; Edit Code &gt; base.css</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Paste the following code at the very bottom:<br><br>[gist]2b9dd915104fb78afd931c9868f5f627[gist]<br><br><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1083\" height=\"820\" class=\"wp-image-2535\" style=\"width: 600px;\" src=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot_13.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot_13.jpg 1083w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot_13-850x644.jpg 850w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot_13-768x581.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1083px) 100vw, 1083px\" /></li>\n\n\n\n<li>You are all set! It is that simple. <br><br>You can change the value <strong>0.2</strong> to change the banner&#8217;s opacity. <br><br>This value goes from 0.01 (transparent) to 1.00 (visible).<br></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Displaying the slideshow&#8217;s banner on top of the image is arguably the most preferred choice when designing a Shopify website for mobile devices. It tends to be more visually appealing, makes more effective use of screen space, and depending on the product being showcased the user experience can also be improved. <br><br>Ultimately, the goal of any website design is to communicate key information effectively and to provide a positive user experience, therefore displaying the banner on top of the image can be one of the steps towards that direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"you-may-also-like\">You may also like</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some other tutorials you may be interested in.
