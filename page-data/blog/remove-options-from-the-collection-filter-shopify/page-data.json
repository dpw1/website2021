Although adding more options can bring a meaningful degree of complexity, it&#8217;s reasonably simpler to remove some of these options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this tutorial I&#8217;ll guide you on how to remove certain options from your collection&#8217;s filter. <br><br><a href=\"https://pandashopdeals.myshopify.com/collections/all\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">You can click here to see a live preview of the end result</a>. The filters &#8220;Featured&#8221; and &#8220;Best selling&#8221; were removed for the sake of this example, but you&#8217;ll learn how to remove any filters.<br><br>Also, please bear in mind that this code will not work on all themes. The following code was confirmed to be compatible with the following themes: Dawn, Ride, Sense, Craft, Colorblock, Crave, Taste, Studio, Refresh.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Making a backup of your theme</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before diving into the tutorial make sure you download the theme, so in case you face any issues you can easily revert back.<br><br><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1514\" height=\"481\" class=\"wp-image-503\" style=\"width: 600px;\" src=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dl-123.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dl-123.png 1514w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dl-123-600x191.png 600w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dl-123-1200x381.png 1200w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dl-123-768x244.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1514px) 100vw, 1514px\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-creating-the-file-with-the-necessary-code\">Creating the file with the necessary code</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>From your Shopify admin, go to <strong>Online Store</strong> > <strong>Themes </strong>> <strong>Actions </strong>> <strong>Edit Code</strong>.</li><li>Under the folder &#8220;snippets&#8221;, click on <em>&#8220;Add a new snippet&#8221;.</em> Name it exactly this:<br><br><strong>ezfy-collection-filter</strong><br><br><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1404\" height=\"646\" class=\"wp-image-1725\" style=\"width: 600px;\" src=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/copy-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/copy-1.jpg 1404w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/copy-1-850x391.jpg 850w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/copy-1-1200x552.jpg 1200w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/copy-1-768x353.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1404px) 100vw, 1404px\" /></li><li>Copy all of the following code and paste it in the file you just created.<br><br>[gist]6db33f31472bc4bc096fc95c065c4e2e[gist]</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-choosing-what-options-to-remove-from-the-filter\">Choosing what options to remove from the filter</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the code has been added to your theme, now you can choose what filters you&#8217;d like to remove. Before I get into the step-by-step of how to do this, keep this cheat sheet in mind, we&#8217;ll need it for the next step:<br><br><strong>Featured = <em>manual</em><br>Best selling = <em>best-selling</em><br>Alphabetically, A-Z = <em>title-ascending</em><br>Alphabetically, Z-A = <em>title-descending</em><br>Price, low to high = <em>price-ascending</em><br>Price, high to low = <em>price-descending</em><br>Date, old to new = <em>created-ascending</em><br>Date, new to old = <em>created-descending</em></strong><br><br>Alright! Now, back to the code:<br><br>1. In the beginning of the file, you&#8217;ll find the following words between backticks:<br><br><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"511\" height=\"157\" class=\"wp-image-1727\" style=\"width: 600px;\" src=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/code-2.jpg\" alt=\"\"><br><br>2. All you have to do is add the words you want and separate them by comma. Make sure you don&#8217;t add a comma to the last word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the example above, the filters &#8220;Featured&#8221; and &#8220;Best selling&#8221; will be removed, since the code for &#8220;Featured&#8221; is &#8220;manual&#8221;, and the code for &#8220;Best selling&#8221; is &#8220;best-selling&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-final-step-enabling-the-code\">Final step: enabling the code</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Find the file named <strong>theme.liquid</strong>.</li><li>Inside this file, press CTRL + F (or CMD + F on Mac) and search for:<br><br><strong>&lt;/body></strong><br></li><li>Paste the following code <strong>before </strong>the <strong>&lt;/body></strong> tag you found and save:<br><br><code>{% include 'ezfy-collection-filter' %}</code></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p><br>And that is it, you&#8217;re good to go! </p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Learn how to remove whatever options you wish from your collection&#8217;s page filter.
