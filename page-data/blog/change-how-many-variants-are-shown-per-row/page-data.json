However, not always this is the most optimal layout for every website, depending on its product and design choices, of course. <br><br>Changing the number of variants per row may be interesting especially for products containing a wide diversity of variations. For instance, if a given store is selling products with numerous variants, displaying them in a single row could potentially make the page look cluttered, crowded and unappealing. While on the other hand, having the option to display fewer variant buttons per row gives the product page the opportunity to present a cleaner, more organized look, which improves the UI and subsequently makes it easier for your customers to form a more adequate opinion in relation to what they&#8217;re looking for. <br><br>Although it may be a simple and seemingly irrelevant detail, being able to A/B test and reach your own conclusions of what does and does not yield positive results is the ideal approach. In the end of the day, if such change improves your conversion rate even by 0.1% it&#8217;s still improvement and it&#8217;s valid. 0.1% at a time you&#8217;ll reach 100%!<br><br>Therefore, in this tutorial I&#8217;ll teach you how you can choose how many variants are shown per row. <br><br><a href=\"https://pandashopdeals.myshopify.com/products/beige-dog-collar?variant=41580778520676\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Here is a live preview of how the end result will look like</a>. <br><br>In this live preview, I have chosen to show 3 variants per row. All it takes is copying and pasting a very simple piece of code.

Having the ability to change how many variant buttons are shown per row may bring numerous benefits, at the very least it&#8217;s worth it testing for a couple days with and without this implementation and see whether you have any positive results in terms of conversions.
