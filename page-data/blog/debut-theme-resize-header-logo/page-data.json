Fortunately it takes very little effort to get it fixed as well. <br><br>Here is how you can quickly get that solved!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-adding-the-code-to-your-theme\">Adding the code to your theme</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>From your Shopify admin, go to&nbsp;<strong>Online Store</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Themes&nbsp;</strong>&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Actions&nbsp;</strong>&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Edit Code</strong>.</li><li>Find&nbsp;the file named <strong>theme.css </strong>or <strong>theme.scss</strong> file.

This type of padding that comes from the image is not possible to be addressed via code. <br><br>To check whether your image has white space around it, open it in a new tab using the browser of your preference. <br><br>Here is an example of a logo our client was using with way too much white space around it:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"773\" src=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-4-1200x773.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1436\" srcset=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-4-1200x773.png 1200w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-4-850x547.png 850w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-4-768x494.png 768w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-4.png 1474w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When adding this to the header&#8217;s logo, it would look way off since the image itself has a lot of white space. <br><br>Therefore, we had to trim it and re-upload to the website. Here is how the final version was looking like, with no excessive white spaces surrounding it:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"925\" height=\"896\" src=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1438\" srcset=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-5.png 925w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-5-850x823.png 850w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-5-768x744.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 925px) 100vw, 925px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And that is it!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Continue reading</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-4 wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some other Debut tutorials you may be interested in:<br><br>&#8211; <a href=\"https://ezfycode.com/blog/debut-shopify-theme-how-to-add-swipe-for-product-page-images\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Add arrows to the product page images;</a><br>&#8211; <a href=\"https://ezfycode.com/blog/debut-theme-product-page-images-zoom-tutorial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Add a &#8220;click to zoom&#8221; on mobile &amp; desktop for product page images.</a><br>&#8211; <a href=\"https://ezfycode.com/blog/debut-theme-sticky-navigation-bar-tutorial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sticky header copy/paste code (with optional sticky announcement bar)</a></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Learn how to resize your Debut theme&#8217;s logo with just a few lines of code.</p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":1447,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[9],"tags":[157],"image_alt":"","acf":[],"featured_image_src":"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/debut-logo-850x478.jpg","featured_image_small_src":"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/debut-logo-200x200.jpg","featured_image_large_src":"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/debut-logo-1200x675.jpg","post_count":null,"categories_names":["Blog"],"tag_names":["debut theme"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://www.ezfy.club/json/wp/v2/posts/1433"}],"collection":[{"href":"https://www.ezfy.club/json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://www.ezfy.club/json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://www.ezfy.club/json/wp/v2/users/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://www.ezfy.club/json/wp/v2/comments?post=1433"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https://www.ezfy.club/json/wp/v2/posts/1433/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1451,"href":"https://www.ezfy.club/json/wp/v2/posts/1433/revisions/1451"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://www.ezfy.club/json/wp/v2/media/1447"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://www.ezfy.club/json/wp/v2/media?parent=1433"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://www.ezfy.club/json/wp/v2/categories?post=1433"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://www.ezfy.club/json/wp/v2/tags?post=1433"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["330429198"]}
