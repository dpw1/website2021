Maybe changing &#8220;add to cart&#8221; to &#8220;add to bag&#8221; or some other minor adjustment that you had no clue how to do?<br><br>Maybe you even found how to change a specific piece of text on the internet, but you weren&#8217;t able to figure out how to change <em>any</em> text. Well, this is no longer going to be an issue! In this tutorial I&#8217;ll be teaching you two ways to change any text that you see on your Shopify store.<br><br>For the sake of today&#8217;s guide, we&#8217;ll be using the Dawn theme<strong> </strong>and changing the &#8220;Add to cart&#8221; text to &#8220;Add to bag&#8221;. However, this tutorial is valid for <strong>any</strong> theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Making a backup of your theme</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before diving into the tutorial make sure you download the theme, so in case you face any issues you can easily revert back.<br><br><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1514\" height=\"481\" class=\"wp-image-503\" style=\"width: 600px;\" src=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dl-123.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dl-123.png 1514w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dl-123-600x191.png 600w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dl-123-1200x381.png 1200w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dl-123-768x244.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1514px) 100vw, 1514px\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-option-1-editing-the-languages-file-of-your-theme\">Option 1: editing the languages&#8217; file of your theme</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>From your Shopify admin, go to&nbsp;<strong>Online Store</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Themes&nbsp;</strong>&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Actions&nbsp;</strong>&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Edit Language</strong>.<br><br><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1246\" height=\"624\" class=\"wp-image-1760\" style=\"width: 600px;\" src=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/f1.jpg\" alt=\"Edit languages page on the Shopify admin\" srcset=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/f1.jpg 1246w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/f1-850x426.jpg 850w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/f1-1200x601.jpg 1200w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/f1-768x385.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1246px) 100vw, 1246px\" /><br></li><li>Find the text that you&#8217;d like to updated.

In this case, here is what you can try:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shopify-theme-file-search/mhchmhfecfdpaifljcfebnlaiaphfkmb\">Click here</a> to download this Google Chrome Extension: (you need to use the Google Chrome browser for this).<br>2. From your Shopify Admin, go to <strong>Online Store &gt; Themes &gt; Edit Code</strong><br>3. In the new box that appears with the extension <em>(top right corner)</em> search for the piece of text that you want to change. You can check the regex box to make it case insensitive.<br>4. If the word you looked for is anywhere in your theme, the file that it&#8217;s in will be highlighted in blue. Simply click on it, find the word and update accordingly.<br><br><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1222\" height=\"575\" class=\"wp-image-1773\" style=\"width: 600px;\" src=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/f4.jpg\" alt=\"Using the EZFY text finder chrome extension\" srcset=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/f4.jpg 1222w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/f4-850x400.jpg 850w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/f4-1200x565.jpg 1200w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/f4-768x361.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1222px) 100vw, 1222px\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If after trying the option 1 and 2 the text that you&#8217;re trying to edit still remains not found, it&#8217;s highly likely that it is being injected by a third party Shopify app. <br><br>In this case, there are still a couple things you could do. If you do know which app it is, try finding an option to edit text within the app&#8217;s configuration panel. If you&#8217;re unable to do so, contacting the app developer is a viable alternative as well.<br><br>Alternatively, you may need to contact a developer to help you find the root cause of the problem. <a href=\"#contact\">Feel free to reach out to us for a free quote.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-you-may-also-like\">You may also like</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ezfycode.com/blog/add-slideshow-shopify-no-apps\">&#8211; How to make slideshow images stop cutting off</a><br><a href=\"https://ezfycode.com/blog/how-to-disable-right-click-image-and-text-copying-without-apps\">&#8211; Disable right click, image and text copying and improve your store&#8217;s security</a></p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Learn how to locate and then change any piece of text within your Shopify store, using either their own resources as well as an external extension.</p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":1790,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[9],"tags":[206],"image_alt":"","acf":[],"featured_image_src":"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/remove-1-850x478.png","featured_image_small_src":"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/remove-1-200x200.png","featured_image_large_src":"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/remove-1-1200x675.png","post_count":null,"categories_names":["Blog"],"tag_names":["all themes"],"featured_image_url":"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/remove-1.png","featured_image_url_alt":"How to update any text on your Shopify store","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https://www.ezfy.club/json/wp/v2/posts/1781"}],"collection":[{"href":"https://www.ezfy.club/json/wp/v2/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https://www.ezfy.club/json/wp/v2/types/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://www.ezfy.club/json/wp/v2/users/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://www.ezfy.club/json/wp/v2/comments?post=1781"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"https://www.ezfy.club/json/wp/v2/posts/1781/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1796,"href":"https://www.ezfy.club/json/wp/v2/posts/1781/revisions/1796"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https://www.ezfy.club/json/wp/v2/media/1790"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https://www.ezfy.club/json/wp/v2/media?parent=1781"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https://www.ezfy.club/json/wp/v2/categories?post=1781"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https://www.ezfy.club/json/wp/v2/tags?post=1781"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["330429198"]}
