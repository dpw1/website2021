In both instances, you understand  the importance of providing a seamless and intuitive user experience (UX) to your visitors.  <br><br>Now, imagine if you could elevate that experience further by allowing your customers to navigate through your product images by barely touching their mouse. It surely is possible, and we&#8217;re here to show you how, just by copy and pasting a piece of high quality code we have spent some days developing and testing to our readers! It works out of the box and makes use of no additional Javascript libraries, such as jQuery (which wildly anchors down your website&#8217;s performance).<br><br>This is particularly useful for stores selling products whose customers typically browse on computers. If in your analytics data you see that most of your traffic is coming from desktop devices, this is going to be a nice add-on to your shop.<br><br>Without further ado, please follow along to learn how you can add this functionality to your theme.
