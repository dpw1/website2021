Having a neat-looking background image on your website can be a bold way to establish your brand: a well thought, beautiful image, abstract or not, carries power with it. With that said, it&#8217;s very important to make sure you choose the right image to not scare visitors away.<br><br>Bearing that vital detail in mind, in this tutorial I&#8217;ll teach how you can add an image to any Shopify theme just in a few minutes.
