It surely is possible, and we&#8217;re here to show you how, just by copy and pasting a piece of high quality code we have spent some days developing and testing to our readers! It works out of the box and makes use of no additional Javascript libraries, such as jQuery (which wildly anchors down your website&#8217;s performance).<br><br>This is particularly useful for stores selling products whose customers typically browse on computers. If in your analytics data you see that most of your traffic is coming from desktop devices, this is going to be a nice add-on to your shop.<br><br>Without further ado, please follow along to learn how you can add this functionality to your theme.

Stores are no exception specially on Shopify, as image sliders and carousels are a perfect way of showing off top sellers, new additions, products on sale and any other kind of collection a store owner might want their clients to find easily. <br><br>It should come to you as no surprise that not only Shopify has a slideshow section, but many developers have created their own apps implementing that very functionality, each with their own twists, vantages and issues. <br><br>The variety is such that it can be hard for Shopify users to pick the slideshow that better match their store and needs, so we tested a few popular slideshow apps, from Shopify&#8217;s default to our own <a href=\"https://ezfycode.com/shop/slideshow-section-pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">EZFY Slideshow Section Pro</a>. You can find out how they compare to each other below.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-shopify-dawn-s-default-slideshow-section\">Shopify Dawn&#8217;s Default Slideshow Section</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have a point of comparison, we&#8217;ll start with the default Shopify Slideshow for Dawn and free themes. It&#8217;s available as a section in the customization page, meaning it&#8217;s easy to access and use at any location of any page which is an advantage compared to some other Slideshow apps that despite having more features, often suffer from a more roundabout implementation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each individual slide can have its own accompanying heading, subheading and button but their customization is virtually non-existent, all of it being laid on top of a box with a few different preset color schemes and an optional black overlay with customizable opacity that blocks the slides. <br><br>The overlay can be disabled but the box can&#8217;t, if you don&#8217;t want the slides&#8217; images to be covered the most you can do is move the box to the least intrusive location. Customization for the slideshow as a whole is similarly limited, with few different options for the section&#8217;s size and sliding speed. It&#8217;s a very basic tool easy to use and does the minimum it needs to, but it&#8217;s as barebones as it can be: it looks and works one way and if you&#8217;d like something different, there&#8217;s barely anything you can do.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-powr\">POWR</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.shopify.com/powr-image-slider?source=ezfycode\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">POWR </a>does not operate directly from you Shopify&#8217;s admin apps section, instead taking you to their slideshow building tool in their own website. It is however easy and intuitive to use and you can learn how to do it in just a few minutes. If you&#8217;re using the free version customization is limited but you still have access to the basics, for example adding text to your slides or even turning images into links that&#8217;ll lead the user to any page of your choosing. <br><br>Text is customizable with font type, color, size and alignment which is already a step up from the default Shopify Slideshow, although you can&#8217;t choose different settings for each individual slide. You&#8217;re also limited to just 3 pictures for each slideshow, but you you can create as many as you want. Paid subscription give you access to a number of advantages as well, from increasingly bigger sliders to more detailed customization options such as special transitions and slider speed, and much more. It&#8217;s a rather versatile tool as well, which can also be used for logos, a hero section and even accepts videos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you created your slider and proceeds to implement it in your store, one thing stands out from other slideshow apps. In most apps we tested newly creates sliders are imported into your store as sections that you can add to any location of any page from your theme customization page, which is a simple way of handling it. POWR however asks you which page of your store should receive the slider and then lets you choose between its top or bottom, with no straightforward way of picking a more specific location. If you want your own custom location you are given the HTML for your slider that you can manually add to your store&#8217;s code, but that&#8217;s a more complicated procedure that takes some know-how.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All in all POWR is a strong slideshow creation tool that offers a surprising amount of options for its free plan and much more depending on how much you&#8217;re willing to pay, with its biggest issue being implementation methods that might be a bit awkward to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-slider-revolution\">Slider Revolution</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.shopify.com/revolution-slider\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Slider Revolution</a> impresses with everything it can do, with dozens upon dozens of pre-built templates for you to choose from, ample customization choices and even the tools necessary to create a variety of other Shopify sections and pages, proving itself to be an even more potent page builder than POWR. While it lacks a free plan, it offers a 7 days trial and has demo store that showcases everything it can do and how you can achieve everything, so you know exactly what you&#8217;re getting into before you subscribe.<br><br>You have access to every tool available straight away, but the number of sliders you can create is limited by your subscription plan in numbers that can be rather harsh depending on your intended use. Its strength is also its biggest weakness however as with options come complexity: while their website offers plenty instructions it&#8217;s still a lot to take in, resulting in a learning process that can be overwhelming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, Slider Revolution is one of the more complete slideshow apps for Shopify, but it can take a while to learn and can be overkill depending on your needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-good-app-galleries\">Good App Galleries</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.shopify.com/good-photo-galleries\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Good Apps Galleries</a> is a lightweight but efficient app that lets you create sliders, carrousels and even static image galleries with a few different layout options. It doesn&#8217;t offer much in terms of customization but is very easy to use, perfect if you&#8217;re looking for something that isn&#8217;t complex. It has no live demo or free trial but the subscription is cheaper than most other apps, giving you access to all features straight away and letting you create limitless galleries and sliders of any size you want, the only limit being that of 1 TB of bandwidth per month. It isn&#8217;t fancy, but it&#8217;ll serve your needs if you&#8217;re looking for something simple and easy to use, or you&#8217;re on a budget and other free sliders aren&#8217;t doing enough for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-enorm-image-slider-pro\">Enorm Image Slider Pro</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.shopify.com/enorm-image-slider\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Enorm</a> is in many ways similar to the POWR image slider we covered above, but differs from it in a few key ways. For starters, it can be accessed directly from your Shopify store&#8217;s admin page without having to go to a different site and sliders can be installed in your store as sections, a more widespread and easier to use method than the one employed by POWR. <br><br>Its free plan only allows you to create a single slider and the number of slideshows you can create even with a paid subscription is somewhat limited, although it allows you to work with a much bigger amount of pictures, starting from 5 for the free plan and going all the way to 600, while POWR limits slideshows to 10 slides long even if you&#8217;re using its most expensive plan. <br><br>We can say that if POWR tickled your fancy you might want to take a look at Enorm too, as it allows you to create less but bigger slideshows with similar customization options and subscriptions plans, but with a more flexible installation method. Both offer a free plan, so you can test them yourself and decide which one works best for you!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-ezfy-slideshow-section-pro\">EZFY Slideshow Section Pro</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://ezfycode.com/shop/slideshow-section-pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Slideshow Section by EZFY</a> works a little different from other Shopify slider creators you&#8217;ll find because as its name implies, it uses custom code to create a new slideshow section for your theme. Installation is simple, involving only some copy and paste code that can be done in a minute or two at most. <br><br>Once it&#8217;s finished the slider creator can be accessed directly from your store&#8217;s customization page much like the default one, with all the practicalities and advantages that method offers: you can create a slideshow on any page of your store directly from there without having to build it in a separate site and then importing it. Since each slider can be created and customized on its own, you have full control of everything you create without having to rely on templates, and no harsh restrictions on the number and size of slideshows either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customization options are plentiful as well, allowing for resizing of images, parallax scrolling and lazy loading for better performance as well as navigation with customizable bars, dots and arrows. You have full control of the text as well with separate customization for font size and color in each piece of text, as well as a second button. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"EZFY Slideshow Section for Shopify – Add a Slideshow to Any Shopify Theme\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UKO9ViFXaWQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can even pick the color for the overlay or add a shadow under the text: you choose how much of the picture remains visible and have all the tools needed to make sure the text continues readable regardless. Much of the customization allows you to pick differing settings for desktop and mobile devices, including the very pictures used in the slides</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It boasts as many options as the best slideshow apps available if not more without any of the restrictions, and when you factor in that it&#8217;s a one time purchase equivalent to 2-3 months worth of the subscription of most other apps, it&#8217;s a clear winner.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-speed-comparison\">Speed Comparison</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While features and customization options are the biggest selling point when choosing which slideshow to use, a not so obvious but important factor to consider as well is performance: some sliders may take a longer or shorter time to load depending on how they&#8217;re coded and hosted, which can be bad for the UX. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We used Google Chrome&#8217;s built in Lighthouse tool to compare how some of the slideshow builders we covered compare to each other.  First we have POWR:<br><br><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"639\" height=\"181\" class=\"wp-image-2809\" style=\"width: 600px;\" src=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/POWR-speed-desktop-1.png\" alt=\"Google Chrome's Lighthouse audit for POWR slideshow.\"><br><br>As you can see it has a performance score of 73, leaving some to be desired. Next we have Enorm:<br><br><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"616\" height=\"175\" class=\"wp-image-2815\" style=\"width: 600px;\" src=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/enorm-speed-desktop.png\" alt=\"Google Chrome's Lighthouse audit for Enorm slideshow.\"><br><br>Similar performance to POWR, but it&#8217;s not only less accessible it also has a considerably lower SEO rating, meaning browsers are less likely to find your store through search engines. If we consider how similar the POWR and Enorm slideshow apps are in terms of features, this  can be a huge deciding factor in favor of the former. Finally, we have EZFY:<br><br><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"567\" height=\"147\" class=\"wp-image-2813\" style=\"width: 600px;\" src=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/EZFY-speed-desktop-1.png\" alt=\"Google Chrome's Lighthouse audit for EZFY slideshow.\"><br><br>Just as accessible and SEO friendly as POWR, but better practices lead to a not insignificant increase to the performance. <br><br>Again, the EZFY slideshow section proves itself to be the best out of the slider creators we have tested.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re a Shopify store owner and are looking for a slideshow app to use there&#8217;s many good options to pick from according to your needs and budget, but <a href=\"https://ezfycode.com/shop/slideshow-section-pro\">EZFY Slideshow Section Pro</a> stands out as one of the most complete options, boasting a high performance as well as a very affordable cost.

However, not always this is the most optimal layout for every website, depending on its product and design choices, of course. <br><br>Changing the number of variants per row may be interesting especially for products containing a wide diversity of variations. For instance, if a given store is selling products with numerous variants, displaying them in a single row could potentially make the page look cluttered, crowded and unappealing. While on the other hand, having the option to display fewer variant buttons per row gives the product page the opportunity to present a cleaner, more organized look, which improves the UI and subsequently makes it easier for your customers to form a more adequate opinion in relation to what they&#8217;re looking for. <br><br>Although it may be a simple and seemingly irrelevant detail, being able to A/B test and reach your own conclusions of what does and does not yield positive results is the ideal approach. In the end of the day, if such change improves your conversion rate even by 0.1% it&#8217;s still improvement and it&#8217;s valid. 0.1% at a time you&#8217;ll reach 100%!<br><br>Therefore, in this tutorial I&#8217;ll teach you how you can choose how many variants are shown per row. <br><br><a href=\"https://pandashopdeals.myshopify.com/products/beige-dog-collar?variant=41580778520676\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Here is a live preview of how the end result will look like</a>. <br><br>In this live preview, I have chosen to show 3 variants per row.

For the past few years, Shopify has chosen to go via the latter route: even the first Shopify themes like Debut and Minimal would always display the Slideshow&#8217;s banner below the images on mobile devices. <br><br>To the amuse of some and the disappointment of others, the same approach has persisted in the latest batch of themes with the Dawn series. <br><br>However, worry not since this is a fairly simple fix. In today&#8217;s tutorial I&#8217;ll show you how you can show slideshow&#8217;s banner on top of the image.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"NoticeBox NoticeBox--info\"><p>This tutorial is compatible only with Shopify&#8217;s official free themes: <b>Dawn, Refresh, Colorblock, Taste, Ride, Studio, Crave, Origin, Spotlight, Publisher, Sense &amp; Craft.</b></p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-step-1-adding-the-code\">Step 1: adding the code</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>From your Shopify admin, navigate to <strong>Online Store &gt; Themes &gt; Actions &gt; Edit Code &gt; base.css</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Paste the following code at the very bottom:<br><br>[gist]2b9dd915104fb78afd931c9868f5f627[gist]<br><br><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1083\" height=\"820\" class=\"wp-image-2535\" style=\"width: 600px;\" src=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot_13.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot_13.jpg 1083w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot_13-850x644.jpg 850w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot_13-768x581.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1083px) 100vw, 1083px\" /></li>\n\n\n\n<li>You are all set!

It tends to be more visually appealing, makes more effective use of screen space, and depending on the product being showcased the user experience can also be improved. <br><br>Ultimately, the goal of any website design is to communicate key information effectively and to provide a positive user experience, therefore displaying the banner on top of the image can be one of the steps towards that direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"you-may-also-like\">You may also like</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some other tutorials you may be interested in.

This section varies in design but its functionality is very similar in all of them: you can add up to 3 collections and easily browser their products without having to scroll up and down. <br><br>Although it&#8217;s a beautiful, well thoughtful section, of course, one still has to purchase the theme to use the section. It is certainly a great call if it&#8217;s within your budget, but for those who are still starting out or are not willing to migrate to a new theme, this can be a deal breaker.<br><br>Bearing that in mind, we have built the code snippet section <em>EZFY Collections Tabs</em>. It&#8217;s a copy &amp; paste code snippet that can be installed into <strong>any theme</strong>, without any technical knowledge. It allows you to organize products into different collections and display them in a tabbed interface. <br><br>This means that customers can easily navigate between different product categories by clicking on the tabs, without having to scroll through a long list of products. Not only this saves customers time and effort, but it also opens massive room conversion optimization since they&#8217;re viewing much more products in less time. <br><br><em>EZFY Collections Tabs</em> code snippet also ships with 100+ customization options.

It even loops around!</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Arrow icons, browse back and forth between images with a single click.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Alternate horizontal navigation scheme with dots replacing thumbnails, perfect for more minimalist designs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re not convinced yet you can see it working live in our demo store <a href=\"https://refresh-password-is-123.myshopify.com/products/flex-bag\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a> (<strong>password: 123</strong>) before learning how to install it below.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-making-a-backup-of-your-theme\">Making a backup of your theme</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before diving into the tutorial make sure you download the theme, so in case you face any issues you can easily revert back.<br><br><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1514\" height=\"481\" class=\"wp-image-503\" style=\"width: 600px;\" src=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dl-123.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dl-123.png 1514w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dl-123-600x191.png 600w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dl-123-1200x381.png 1200w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dl-123-768x244.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1514px) 100vw, 1514px\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-downloading-the-files\">Downloading the files</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ezfycode.com/shop/refresh-theme-slider-pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Download </strong>the files by clicking here.</a> (<a href=\"https://refresh-password-is-123.myshopify.com//products/flex-bag\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">live preview</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-step-1-inserting-the-top-code\">Step 1: inserting the &#8220;top&#8221; code</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>In your Shopify admin, click in order:&nbsp;<strong>Online Store</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Themes&nbsp;</strong>&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Actions&nbsp;</strong>&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Edit Code</strong>.<br><br><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1254\" height=\"367\" class=\"wp-image-2238\" style=\"width: 600px;\" src=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/refresh-edit-code.png\" alt=\"Opening the code editor in the refresh theme\" srcset=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/refresh-edit-code.png 1254w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/refresh-edit-code-850x249.png 850w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/refresh-edit-code-1200x351.png 1200w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/refresh-edit-code-768x225.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1254px) 100vw, 1254px\" /><br></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Search for the following in the seach bar:<br><br><strong>main-product.liquid</strong><br><br>And open the file that&#8217;ll show up.<br> <br><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"872\" height=\"632\" class=\"wp-image-1562\" style=\"width: 600px;\" src=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dawn-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dawn-1.jpg 872w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dawn-1-850x616.jpg 850w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dawn-1-768x557.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 872px) 100vw, 872px\" /><br></li>\n\n\n\n<li>You&#8217;ll find a file called <strong>top.txt</strong> inside the .zip you downloaded.

If you think they look good the way they are right now, then you&#8217;re done and don&#8217;t need to modify any more code! <br><br>If you&#8217;d like to further customize them, the following steps will teach you how to modify the CSS values. Note than when this guide points to a line, it refers to the <strong>line in the code you copied above</strong>, <em>not </em>the line from your store&#8217;s code you pasted it in.<br><br></li><li>First off you might need to align the icon with the rest of your navigation menu, that&#8217;s easy to do: just increase the number from line 11 to move the whole icon down or decrease it to move it up. Make sure not to leave any empty space between the number and the &#8220;px&#8221;.<br><br></li><li>You can change the color of the icon with the code in line 15 which has been set by default to black. You can replace it by directly naming a color such as blue, an rgb code like rgb(0, 0, 255) or an hexadecimal code like #0000f7. Either of these examples will result in the same shade of blue, it&#8217;s up to you which method you&#8217;re more comfortable with!<br><br></li><li>Finally, you can change the size of the text you created by changing the number in line 20, again remember to leave no empty space after the number and before the &#8220;px&#8221;. You can also change its color in line 21, using the same method described in step 3 above. Once you&#8217;re done, don&#8217;t forget to click the &#8220;save&#8221; button on the top right corner of the page!</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re done!

When selling products with strong artistic sense behind them it&#8217;s common practice to try and make the best of the available space, no matter how small it is, by using thumbnails to showcase all the variety available for purchase. The default horizontal layout of the Studio theme’s might not be the most suited for such a thing however, as your clients can have a harder time getting a good view of each of your product&#8217;s finer details.<br><br>This can be discouraging for your clients as browsing though your store might turn into a chore, and worst case scenario they&#8217;ll even give up on a purchase. Using this vertical scheme for product thumbnails, arrows for scrolling included, your clients will have an easier time looking through your products and finding the perfect one for them. <br><br>Overall there is a number of important UX elements that the Studio theme lacks, for example:<br><br>&#8211; image arrows;<br>&#8211; looping products images;<br>&#8211; vertical thumbnails;<br>&#8211; sync swatches when images change (and the other way around).<br>&#8211; dots; <br><br>Such functionalities can certainly improve a store, but the time and effort required to implement them can be a big discouragement for owners of a Studio theme store.

In this case, here is what you can try:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shopify-theme-file-search/mhchmhfecfdpaifljcfebnlaiaphfkmb\">Click here</a> to download this Google Chrome Extension: (you need to use the Google Chrome browser for this).<br>2. From your Shopify Admin, go to <strong>Online Store &gt; Themes &gt; Edit Code</strong><br>3. In the new box that appears with the extension <em>(top right corner)</em> search for the piece of text that you want to change. You can check the regex box to make it case insensitive.<br>4. If the word you looked for is anywhere in your theme, the file that it&#8217;s in will be highlighted in blue. Simply click on it, find the word and update accordingly.<br><br><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1222\" height=\"575\" class=\"wp-image-1773\" style=\"width: 600px;\" src=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/f4.jpg\" alt=\"Using the EZFY text finder chrome extension\" srcset=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/f4.jpg 1222w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/f4-850x400.jpg 850w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/f4-1200x565.jpg 1200w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/f4-768x361.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1222px) 100vw, 1222px\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If after trying the option 1 and 2 the text that you&#8217;re trying to edit still remains not found, it&#8217;s highly likely that it is being injected by a third party Shopify app. <br><br>In this case, there are still a couple things you could do. If you do know which app it is, try finding an option to edit text within the app&#8217;s configuration panel. If you&#8217;re unable to do so, contacting the app developer is a viable alternative as well.<br><br>Alternatively, you may need to contact a developer to help you find the root cause of the problem. <a href=\"#contact\">Feel free to reach out to us for a free quote.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-you-may-also-like\">You may also like</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ezfycode.com/blog/add-slideshow-shopify-no-apps\">&#8211; How to make slideshow images stop cutting off</a><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UKO9ViFXaWQ\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\">&amp;lt;br>&amp;lt;a href=&#8221;https://ezfycode.com/blog/collection-with-tabs-shopify-section-tutorial&#8221; target=&#8221;_blank&#8221; rel=&#8221;noreferrer noopener&#8221;>- Add a collection tabs slider to any store (copy/paste, no apps, blazing fast)&amp;lt;/a>&amp;lt;iframe width=&#8221;560&#8243; height=&#8221;315&#8243; src=&#8221;https://www.youtube.com/embed/MuD0FgqENoc&#8221; title=&#8221;YouTube video player&#8221; frameborder=&#8221;0&#8243; allow=&#8221;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&#8221; allowfullscreen=&#8221;&#8221;>&amp;amp;amp;lt;br>&amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=&#8221;https://ezfycode.com/blog/how-to-disable-right-click-image-and-text-copying-without-apps&#8221;>- Disable right click, image and text copying and improve your store&#8217;s security&amp;amp;amp;lt;/a></iframe><br><a href=\"https://ezfycode.com/blog/collection-with-tabs-shopify-section-tutorial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8211; How to add a collection with tabs section to any theme (copy/paste, no apps, blazing fast)</a><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MuD0FgqENoc\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\"><br><br></p>\n","slug":"change-any-text-on-your-shopify-store-works-on-all-themes","date":"2022-10-23T10:30:27.000Z","featured_image_src":"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/remove-1-850x478.png","image_alt":"","excerpt":"<p>Learn how to locate and then change any piece of text within your Shopify store, using either their own resources as well as an external extension.</p>\n","tag_names":["all themes"]},{"title":"How to remove options from the collection filter on your Shopify theme","content":"\n<p>By default, most Shopify themes come with a few standard options to filter your products.

Now, back to the code:<br><br>1.

The most obvious updates that are often discussed and requested are:<br><br>&#8211; vertical thumbnails;<br>&#8211; arrows;<br>&#8211; loop images;<br>&#8211; dots; <br>&#8211; sync swatches when images change (and vice-versa).<br><br>More importantly, while these updates can be nice, just hard coding them into the theme and having it permanently stuck there would not be of great use. <br><br>Being able to enable/disable these features to effortlessly A/B test and see what works better for the businesses is actually the ideal scenario.<br><br>Therefore, today I&#8217;ll teach you how you can add these features (plus a lot more customizable options) just by pasting one piece of code. The best part is that: <strong>customizations will not be overwritten</strong>. If you have any custom code, it will still be there afterward!

You&#8217;re excited to upload it to your website, and when you finally do so, you notice a problem: it is either way too small or with lots of space surrounding it. <br><br>It&#8217;s natural to assume it could be something easily fixed with a piece of code (and sometimes it could indeed be the case), but more often than not the issue is not related to code at all, it&#8217;s related to the image itself. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-understanding-the-problem\">Understanding the problem</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at the following example:<br></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"514\" src=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image-1200x514.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1488\" srcset=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image-1200x514.png 1200w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image-850x364.png 850w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image-768x329.png 768w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image.png 1322w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the logo per se looks ok, it is looking really small when loaded to the website. And, when we increase the logo&#8217;s width, you can notice the header&#8217;s height gets obnoxiously large:<br><br></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"671\" src=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image-3-1200x671.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1498\" srcset=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image-3-1200x671.png 1200w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image-3-850x475.png 850w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image-3-768x429.png 768w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image-3.png 1288w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what is the problem there? It&#8217;s actually quite simple: the white space surrounding the image is adding extra padding to the website. This can not (well, rather <em>should<strong> </strong></em>not<em><strong>)</strong></em> be fixed with code. You must trim the white space around it. <br><br>In this particular example the logo&#8217;s background is white, but it could be of any color or even transparent, it would still be adding unnecessary space. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How to actually fix the problem</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To fix it you just have to trim all the empty space surrounding your logo with an image editing software. For the sake of simplicity, in this tutorial I&#8217;ll be using the <a href=\"https://www.iloveimg.com/crop-image?source=ezfycode\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">I Love Image&#8217;s online image cropper</a>. It is free and very simple to use. Just upload your logo to the website, trim the white space around it and download the new image. Here is how our logo looks now without any white space around it:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"619\" height=\"444\" src=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1492\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And here is how it looks in our header:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"632\" src=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image-2-1200x632.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1494\" srcset=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image-2-1200x632.png 1200w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image-2-850x448.png 850w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image-2-768x404.png 768w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/image-2.png 1358w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is how you can fix your logo&#8217;s spacing without touching any code.

This type of padding that comes from the image is not possible to be addressed via code. <br><br>To check whether your image has white space around it, open it in a new tab using the browser of your preference. <br><br>Here is an example of a logo our client was using with way too much white space around it:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"773\" src=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-4-1200x773.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1436\" srcset=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-4-1200x773.png 1200w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-4-850x547.png 850w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-4-768x494.png 768w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-4.png 1474w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When adding this to the header&#8217;s logo, it would look way off since the image itself has a lot of white space. <br><br>Therefore, we had to trim it and re-upload to the website. Here is how the final version was looking like, with no excessive white spaces surrounding it:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"925\" height=\"896\" src=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1438\" srcset=\"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-5.png 925w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-5-850x823.png 850w, https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-5-768x744.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 925px) 100vw, 925px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And that is it!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Continue reading</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 id=\"you-may-also-like\">You may also like</h3>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"custom-you-may-also-like\">Here are some other tutorials you may be interested in:<br><a href=\"https://ezfycode.com/blog/debut-shopify-theme-how-to-add-swipe-for-product-page-images\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8211; Add arrows &amp; swiping to Debut product pages<span><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media3.giphy.com/media/3EkLfaQZ4YQKaZ26OY/giphy.gif\"></span></a><br><a href=\"https://ezfycode.com/blog/debut-theme-product-page-images-zoom-tutorial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8211; Debut &#8220;click to zoom&#8221; lightbox tutorial: mobile friendly images, slider &amp; arrows<span><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media1.giphy.com/media/WR5Yl3hW8x6aUilwRe/giphy.gif\"></span></a><br><a href=\"https://ezfycode.com/blog/how-to-disable-right-click-image-and-text-copying-without-apps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8211; Improve your website&#8217;s safety: block right click, image copying and more</a></p>\n","slug":"debut-theme-resize-header-logo","date":"2022-01-31T04:13:33.000Z","featured_image_src":"https://www.ezfy.club/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/debut-logo-850x478.jpg","image_alt":"","excerpt":"<p>Learn how to resize your Debut theme&#8217;s logo with just a few lines of code.</p>\n","tag_names":["debut theme"]},{"title":"Dawn theme: add a &#8220;Read More&#8221; button to the product page","content":"\n<p>When you are announcing products that require descriptions that are rich in details, they can end up adding a large wall of text to your product page which, very likely, will end up scaring your potential customers  away.<br><br>A common solution for this type of problem is adding a &#8220;read more&#8221; type of button.

Having a neat-looking background image on your website can be a bold way to establish your brand: a well thought beautiful image, abstract or not, carries power with it. <br><br>One important thing to understand is that most modern Shopify themes are built on top of sections, therefore adding a background image to the website itself would unlikely yield any results. <br><br>As an example, imagine you&#8217;re placing lego blocks on top of an orange lego wall. Although the wall is orange, the other lego pieces will be on top of it so you won&#8217;t be able to say see that it is orange. In this analogy, the wall is your &lt;body&gt; tag and the other pieces are the Shopify sections. <br><br>Therefore, in this tutorial we&#8217;ll cover how you can add an image to both the website (the orange lego wall) and how you can add an image to each individual section (the lego pieces). At the end we&#8217;ll also take a look into optimizing your image&#8217;s performance.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-upload-the-image-to-your-website\">Upload the image to your website</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First things first, let&#8217;s upload the image that will be shown on your website.

For the sake of learning this is fine, but in a real world store you don&#8217;t want to use images that large, especially as a background image. <br><br>I would recommend an image that is at most 500kb, also make sure you use <strong>.webp</strong> instead of .jpg. WEBP performs much better. <br><br>If you&#8217;re working alongside a developer you may also want to look into developing a custom choice for your theme where you can implement lazyloading, add a custom field to quickly upload images at the customize page and some other additional functionalities to easily A/B test what works the best for your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-final-thoughts\">Final thoughts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding a background image to certain themes may require a different approach, unfortunately it&#8217;s difficult to develop an &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; solution. If the tutorial didn&#8217;t work, kindly let us know in details what is the issue you are having and the theme you are using in the <strong>&#8220;was this article helpful&#8221;</strong> box.

Depending on your theme, you can easily find and change them on the Customize page of your theme and play around with a few different styles and combinations.<br><br>However, one thing that is not quite straightforward in Shopify is: how exactly can you add your own custom fonts? Say you have downloaded a new font and you have now a few <strong>.ttf, .woff</strong>, <strong>.woff2, </strong>and/or some other file extensions. How would you go about adding them to your theme and, equally important, making them the default instead of whichever font was previously being used?<br><br>In this tutorial, I&#8217;ll be teaching you how to achieve that.
